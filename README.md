 **Recommendations**
- Limit discounting on high-margin products
- Improve shipping logistics in underperforming regions
- Focus on top-selling products to drive profitability

 **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporate external market data for benchmarking
- Add predictive forecasting using Power BI AI visuals
